Welcome to the README of **Discharge Rate Indicator** for Ubuntu Unity desktop environment.  

This application indicator resides in the Applicaton/Top bar and displays the instantaneous power usage a.k.a discharge rate of the battery every 3 seconds. There is a visual indicator too that averages the instantaneous values for 5 measurements. 

#### Name
**dis-ra-dicator** : discharge-rate-indicator  
Has a dinosaury ðŸ¦– vibe to it.....velociraptor, disradicator......maybe more of a Terminator vibe !  
Or, as pointed out by [Raghu](https://github.com/krishraghuram)  
**dis-radicator** : discharge-eradicator  
Which is also accurate as it keeps you aware of your discharge rate thereby helping you slow it down.
