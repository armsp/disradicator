# Discharge Rate Indicator
Welcome to the README of **Discharge Rate Indicator** for Ubuntu Unity desktop environment.  

This application indicator resides in the Applicaton/Top bar and displays the instantaneous power usage a.k.a discharge rate of the battery every 3 seconds. There is a visual indicator too that averages the instantaneous values for 5 measurements.
