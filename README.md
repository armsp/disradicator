Welcome to the README of **Discharge Rate Indicator** for Ubuntu Unity desktop environment.  

This application indicator resides in the Applicaton/Top bar and displays the instantaneous power usage a.k.a discharge rate of the battery every 3 seconds. There is a visual indicator too that averages the instantaneous values for 5 measurements. 

### Name
**dis-ra-dicator** : discharge-rate-indicator  
Has a dinosaury ðŸ¦– vibe to it.....velociraptor, disradicator......maybe more of a Terminator vibe !  
Or, as pointed out by [Raghu](https://github.com/krishraghuram)  
**dis-radicator** : discharge-eradicator  
Which is also accurate as it keeps you aware of your discharge rate thereby helping you slow it down.

## Dependencies Installation
Refer [this gist](https://gist.github.com/armsp/f8ebd071741a60b3cf20c809310170e7) for a docker image that can run any python3 gobject script. You can also try to understand the dependencies from there.

| PACKAGE | Installation |
| :--- | :--- |
| python3-gi | apt-get install python3-gi |
| python3-gi-cairo | apt-get install python3-gi-cairo |
| gir1.2-gtk-3.0 | apt-get install gir1.2-gtk-3.0 |
| gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 | apt-get install gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 |
| libgirepository1.0-dev | apt-get install libgirepository1.0-dev |
| pygobject | pip3 install pygobject |

Not sure about these but might help -
  - python3-gi-cairo
  - gobject-introspection
  - libgtk-3-dev
  - python3-pyside

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Extract and go inside the root folder
3. Execute `pip3 install -e .` ( It installs it in development mode. This way you can keep pulling changes from my repository and the changes would be reflected immediately in your environment )
4. Open your terminal and type **disradicator** and press enter.
5. Watch the magic unfold on your Top/Activity bar, right-hand side most probably.
